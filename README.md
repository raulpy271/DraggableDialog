# Create A Draggable, Resizable, and Custom Dialog

![Terminal in browser](/assets/socialImage.png)

This a library that use Vanilla Javascript to create draggable dialogs that are responsive and easy to use. He automates the process of create events that listen to the user drags the dialog. He listens to touches and clicks, so the dialog will be draggable on phones too. 

So, you don't need to worry about creating this event to handle clicks and touches and move the dialog, you will only create the html and styles of the dialog, and the lib will turn it draggable.

## Why?

The dialog box in sites are very common, they have different utilities. But, I don't know something that helps developers to automate the process of creating Draggable dialogs. I only found a snippet of codes that are either poorly documented or difficult to custom, or with another mistake. 

So to help me and the others, I decided to write a lib turn conteiners draggable, and can be custom, he should be easy to use and well documented.

## Examples

## Installation

## documentation

## TODO 

As always, I have created a to-do list to help me to maintain a clear path to what to do, and help others to know what do to contribute. So, feels free to make this.

 - Create Examples
 - Add tests
