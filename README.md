# Create A Draggable, Resizable, and Custom Dialog

![Terminal in browser](/public/socialImage.png)

## Why?

The dialog box in sites are very common, they have different utilities. But, I don't know something that helps developers to automate the process of creating Draggable dialogs. I only found a snippet of codes that are either poorly documented or difficult to custom, or with another mistake. 

So to help me and the others, I decided to write a React component that is Draggable, Resizable, and can be custom, he should be easy to use and well documented.

## Examples

## Getting Started

## documentation

## TODO 

As always, I have created a to-do list to help me to maintain a clear path to what to do, and help others to know what do to contribute. So, feels free to make this.
