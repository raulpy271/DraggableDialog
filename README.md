# Create A Draggable, Resizable, and Custom Dialog

![Terminal in browser](/public/socialImage.png)

This a ReactJS Component that helps to create draggable dialogs that are responsive and work on phones too. He automates the process of create events that lister to the user drags the dialog. 

So, you don't need to worry about creating this event to handle clicks and touch's, you will only create the styles. 

## Why?

The dialog box in sites are very common, they have different utilities. But, I don't know something that helps developers to automate the process of creating Draggable dialogs. I only found a snippet of codes that are either poorly documented or difficult to custom, or with another mistake. 

So to help me and the others, I decided to write a React component that is Draggable, Resizable, and can be custom, he should be easy to use and well documented.

## Examples

## Getting Started

## documentation

## TODO 

As always, I have created a to-do list to help me to maintain a clear path to what to do, and help others to know what do to contribute. So, feels free to make this.
